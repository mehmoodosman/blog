- Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedom—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.
- No one has the right to do wrong; not even if wrong has been done to them
- Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning
- The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management
- Anticipatory anxiety —> paradoxical intention
- Every human being has the freedom to change at any instant
