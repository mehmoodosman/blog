I’ve always admired creativity despite not being aware of its significance. Perhaps it is the representation of one’s ideology or the exhortation of their desires. Something which cannot be expressed through mere words alone. Why go through such an arduous task just to voice your opinion? The insoluble dilemma to be discerned by esoteric individuals or remain an enigma for eternity.
Articulation of meaning and the voice of begrudging words.
