Languidly, I walked home, with raspy breathing as if my heart would burst right through my chest at any moment. Fatigue had enveloped my body; each step that I took towards my destination brought rustling jolts of pain throughout my body. Despite all this a shroud of calm serenity had overtaken my mind and with decent resignation I gave in to the whistling of the gentle cool breeze of the morning, the sun that feigned asleep despite illuminating scattered light of rays. This idyllic feeling had controverted the pain that I felt. Voices of laughter and joy resonated around as if blending in with the atmosphere around. Everyone seemed to be in jovial spirits which contradicted the evocative memories of yesterday in my mind; The lie that I had conjured. At this point I feared that it was becoming more of a habit to the point that I would invariably lie about my personal life and everything that made me unique to deceive everyone, including myself. Connecting my fantasy to the person I wish I was rather than the person I am. Invoked on just to avoid being judged by society and to not incur its wrath, except for pertinent prerogative individuals, who would be considered as role models for all the others and those that failed to do so would as a result be shunned by society.
